*EXTREMELY IMPORTANT*
Make sure you add the following to your .bashrc file
export ${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}=~/catkin_ws/src/ros-gazebo/plugins/build

*HOW TO USE*
1. start roscore
2. navigate to build folder in rover_plugin
3. run "gazebo --verbose" at this location
4. using gaebo GUI insert a rover
 
*Note:*
Will be a bitch for compuational resources if you have too many rovers driving around
